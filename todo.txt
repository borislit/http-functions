1) think about how to handle execution timeout
2) think if we want to handle permissions in this level, or is it higher level
3) need to think about sanitizing stack traces (both in exception and console.trace)
4) allow to control the endpoint in runtime instead of through webpack config (is it needed?)
5) csrf token support - how should it work? do we need to give the user an option to play with request before it goes out?
6) references (dup json) and circular
