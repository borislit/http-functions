1) think about serializing things like dates, regexp, etc.
2) think about how to handle execution timeout
3) think if we want to handle permissions in this level, or is it higher level
4) need to think about sanitizing stack traces (both in exception and console.trace)
5) allow to control the endpoint in runtime instead of through webpack config (is it needed?)
