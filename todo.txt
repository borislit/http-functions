1) serialize exceptions so stack is visible on client (use errio node module)
2) think about serializing things like dates, regexp, etc.
3) think about how to handle execution timeout
4) think if we want to handle permissions in this level, or is it higher level
5) need to think about sanitizing stack traces (both in exception and console.trace)
